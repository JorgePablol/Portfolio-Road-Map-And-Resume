# [Introducing Myself](#Table-Of-Contents)
Hello my name is Jorge Pablo I'm from Mexico and I live in Mexico too, I have a clean philosophy that is: I live my own way of living strictly respecting the others life project.

What got me into data science at first was my passion for chess, I discovered I had extraordinary analytical skills when I was learning chess. What I liked from chess was the analysis and the strategy you know short-term actions directed by long-term objectives.

I won some tournaments, achieved 1600 Official ELO not online ELO, and I was also professor of chess for 4 years for my high school. I loved to work as a professor it was a great time of my life but at some point I had a problem with chess and that is that it doesn't matter for real life or reality, chess doesn't have an impact in real life decisions and therefore the hours of study, training and analysis don't even matter. Plot twist I decided to study psychology haha, I liked behavioural pyschology and cognitive psychology, they weren't teaching much of that, they were teaching psychoanalisis so I left and yes they were lazy hippies. 

So I decided to start learning something that fits my personality, makes me happy and has a future in terms of $$$, that intersection is called data science, the place you can express your passion for analysis, the creativity that leads to a better strategy, the need for effective communication for better decision making, the coolness of being at the top of the technology, the future of Machine Learning and the ca$h all together, so I started learning online almost all day for a couple of years and then went to organizations to take the initiative to do data analysis for them, after that, yes, after that I'm here, hope you like my profile.

## [My Vision As A Data Scientist](#Table-Of-Contents)
My vision for data science is the vision from a chess player, a chess professor and a strategy lover, that means I love to analyse the data you give me in order to generate a logic representation of the reality, I like as a professor to communicate effectively so my mates can understand what I'm saying and as a strategist the most important after the communication is the direction we will take in the long term and how our values will take an important role to choose a direction for the organization.

## [Educational Background](#Table-Of-Contents)
I studied entirely via online with the company Platzi, my grade is certification on Platzi's Data Science School, I also have on Artificial Intelligence School but I need more time to take what I learned to practice. 
Other part of the study was based on the scraping you can see in my repositories, there I took the best books ever for data science and made a list on what are the best reads, so I read a lot on the topic, just as complement.
I'm also certified by Platzi from their english school.

## [Work Experience](#Table-Of-Contents)
I have work experience in 2 companies:

* Desansiedad (1 month): They are a company that offers anxiety treatment, I analized their entire google analytics and presented the insights to the marketing team. I did something similar like an internship there.
* Partido Libertario Mx (6 months): They are a new organization trying to be the first libertarian party of Mexico, my work has been to analyse their data from social networks, their affiliates data and the impact of their events, the reports I do impact the decision making of the organization. At first I started proposing myself to analyse their data but now I work with them to delivery their monthly reports, and also to report the impacts of events they host.
